</p>
<p>
After installing osTicket, administrators and support agents log in through the Admin Panel at http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php, which provides access to system settings and ticket management tools. This is where agents can configure roles, departments, SLAs, and respond to incoming tickets. End users, on the other hand, submit and track their support requests through the client portal at http://localhost/osTicket.

</p>
<p>
In the Admin Panel, go to Agents > Roles to create roles like ‚ÄúSupreme Admin‚Äù that define what actions agents can perform. Next, navigate to Agents > Departments to organize agents into groups such as ‚ÄúSysAdmins‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupport,‚Äù which control ticket visibility. Then, under Agents > Teams, create teams like ‚ÄúOnline Banking‚Äù by combining agents from different departments to collaborate on specific types of issues.

</p>
<p>
To control who can submit support tickets, go to the Admin Panel, then Settings > User Settings. Uncheck the box that allows unregistered users to create tickets, which ensures that only registered users can submit requests. This helps maintain a more secure and manageable ticketing system by requiring user authentication.

</p>
<p>
In the Admin Panel, go to Agents > Add New to create agent accounts like Spongebob (assigned to SysAdmins) and Patrick (assigned to Support). Agents are staff members who manage and respond to tickets. To add end users (customers), switch to the Agent Panel, go to Users > Add New, and create profiles for users like Karen and Ken who will submit support requests.

</p>
<p>
In the Admin Panel, navigate to Manage > SLA to create Service Level Agreements such as Sev-A, Sev-B, and Sev-C, each with different response time expectations and schedules. These SLAs help prioritize tickets based on urgency and ensure timely support. Then go to Manage > Help Topics to create categories like Password Reset or Business Critical Outage, which users select when submitting tickets to streamline routing and handling.
